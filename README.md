## Context

I need to develop a currency calculator, using data from [here.](https://mindicador.cl)

It also needs to show a graph with currency fluctuation from the past 10 days.

## View

Let's check this wonderful piece of software [here.](https://pelafustan.github.io/js_in_web-challenge_06/)

## TODO

* Change color depending on status.
* Block other options when task is marked as completed or cancelled.
* I'm quite sure that I'm forgetting somethig, but maybe it isn't important.
